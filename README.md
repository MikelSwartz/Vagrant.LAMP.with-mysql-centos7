# vagrant
* Common vagrant files for use with Vagrant learning and testing vagrant projects.
* Configuration to provision a LAMP stack with Centos/7 in Vagrant.
* Project uses mysql (Not a preference, but for a challenge as CENTOS7 defaults to MariaDB (Sorry Oracle).) 
* SELinux is enabled. (Get used to it until we come up with something better.) 

To test, enter in a browser:
`localhost:8085` This should return the greeting. 
`localhost:8085/info.php` This should return the php version info.
