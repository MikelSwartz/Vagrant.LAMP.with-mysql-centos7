# vagrant
*Common vagrant files for use with Vagrant learning and testing vagrant projects.
*Configuration to provision a LAMP stack with Centos/7 in Vagrant.
*Project uses mysql (Not a preference, but for a challenge as CENOTS7 defaults to MariaDB (Sorry Oracle).) 
*SELinux is enabled. (Get used to it until we come up with something better.)
